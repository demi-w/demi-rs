My name is Demi Willison. I've just graduated in Computer Science at SSU and I've been programming since 2011. Through my five years at Local Search Appeal, I managed and updated hundreds of websites, made/updated HTML/CSS/JavaScript according to the additional needs of our clients, and wrote helper scripts in Python to automate our workflows. In college, I wrote upper-division curriculum for Physics majors as a freshman. Currently, while I am looking for work, I am continuing my senior capstone work with my professor with the plan to submit our work to conferences.
