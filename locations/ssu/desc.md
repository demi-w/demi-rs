My time at SSU was great, as I had been dreaming about taking classes almost entirely about Computer Science for a long time. I had done a lot of programming work beforehand, but a formal education was definitely both necessary and beneficial for my ability to work in the future. Some courses I want to highlight (recieved an A/A- in all listed courses):

- Data Structures
- Software Design & Development
- Theory of Computation
- Operating Systems
- Senior Research Project
- Computer Architecture
