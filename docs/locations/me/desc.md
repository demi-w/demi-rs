My name is Demi Willison. I just graduated in May of 2023 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from Sonoma State University and I've been programming since 2011. Through my five years at Local Search Appeal, I managed and updated hundreds of websites, made/updated HTML/CSS/JavaScript according to the additional needs of our clients, and wrote helper scripts in Python to automate our workflows. In college, I wrote upper-division curriculum for Physics majors as a freshman. Currently, while I am looking for work, I am continuing my senior capstone work with Dr. Ravikumar, with the plan to submit our work to conferences.
