This project was created in collaboration with Amit Deb and Bella Gonzalez.

Created in the span of a couple weeks, Go Fish: Definitive Edition was our final project for CS 370 (Problem Solving in a Team Environment). Being responsible for the internal game logic, graphics rendering, and some networking, there were some complex challenges to face in that time frame. Here's the architecture that I eventually devised:

Working off of my experience with 3 Years War, I built a decoupled game logic and game rendering system. More specifically, it used a variant of the MVC paradigm, where events fired from the model went into an animation queueing system that would play back those events in the order recieved, but with delays so that gameplay was actually readable. This made things simple on the game logic end: When a player draws a card, fire an event that the card was drawn and continue running through the logic at any speed. This allowed all bot actions to be computed instantly while still allowing the player's view of events to be easily understood, alongside other benefits.

Additionally, gameplay/bot logic was completely deterministic when using seeded RNG, allowing the only messages that needed to come over the network to be the number of bots/players, player names, RNG seed, and player actions. This greatly simplified the networking, as aside from initialization, networked players could be implemented almost identically to the way that bots were implemented.
