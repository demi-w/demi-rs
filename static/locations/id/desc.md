As an online instructor for iD Tech Camps, I wrote individualized curriculum for students in one-on-one sessions. While I have no intention of retaining that job indefinitely, it was definitely some of the most fun I've ever had at work. Working with students (especially younger students) who were intimidated by Computer Science was a joy as I showed them how intuitive the field could really be. iD Tech attempted to work with students where they were at, so a lot of sessions were held within Roblox or Minecraft or modding tools that students would actually be interested in learning about. This work was done remotely, an additional challenge when working with younger students, as I was often working with students who were younger than 10 years old.
